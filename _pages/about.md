Hi! My name is Linqiang He, a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University.

In July 2024, I received my PhD in Meteorology at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, working with Prof. [Tianjun Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OTl3HEQAAAAJ&hl=en).

Now, I have been a postdoc at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, working with Prof. [Michela Biasutti](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~biasutti/) and Prof. [Yochanan Kushnir](https://lamont.columbia.edu/directory/yochanan-kushnir).

My research explores the Earthâ€™s climate evolution, with a recent focus on monsoon and Mediterranean climates. By combining proxy records, model simulations, and physical diagnostics, I aim to uncover past climate dynamics and identify analogs for future change. I am also deeply interested in applying machine learning techniques and paleoclimate data assimilation to climate research.
