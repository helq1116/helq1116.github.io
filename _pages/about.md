**About me**
Welcome to my homepage! I am Linqiang He (helq@lasg.iap.ac.cn), a Ph.D. student at the [Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.iap.cas.cn/). 

Over the past three years, my research have focused on the simulation and evolution of the monsoon. By integrating proxy records, climate simulations, and physical diagnoses, I investigate the formation of modern monsoon and the indication of past warm periods for the future change. I was also involved in the research of ENSO climate impacts and extreme precipitation changes in the early stage of my Ph.D.. 

Overall, I have strong backgrounds in paleoclimate, climate dynamics, and model simulation. And I am also intersted in the application of machine learning methods in the climate research.


**News**
*I will get my Ph.D. in  June 2024, and I am looking for a postdoc position in climate science.*
