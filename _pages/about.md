## About me

Welcome! ðŸ˜Š  I am Linqiang He, a Postdoc in the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.

My research focuses on the simulation and evolution of Earth's climate. By integrating proxy records, model simulations and physical diagnoses, I aim to understand the underlying mechanisms of the present climate from the perspective of past climate evolution, and to provide potential analogs for future climate change. In the early stages, I am also involved in research on the climate impacts of ENSO and changes in extreme precipitation. 

Overall, I have a strong background in palaeoclimate, climate dynamics and model simulation. I am also interested in the application of machine learning methods to climate research.
