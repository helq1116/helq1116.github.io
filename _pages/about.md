## About me

Welcome! I am Linqiang He, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University.

My research focuses on the simulation and evolution of Earth's climate, with a recent emphasis on monsoon and Mediterranean climates. By integrating proxy records, model simulations, and physical diagnostics, my goal is to uncover the dynamics of past climate evolution and identify potential analogs for future climate change.

I am also deeply interested in applying machine learning techniques and paleoclimate data assimilation to climate research.
