I am Linqiang He, a postdoctoral researcher at LDEO, Columbia University.

My research explores the Earth's climate evolution, with a recent focus on monsoon and Mediterranean climates. By combining proxy records, model simulations, and physical diagnostics, I aim to uncover past climate dynamics and identify analogs for future change.

I am also deeply interested in applying machine learning techniques and paleoclimate data assimilation to climate research.
